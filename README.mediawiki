== BlazeDS extension and HelloWorld example for RobotLegs2 ==

This is the source code to the ActionScript layer of my extensive tutorial on BlazeDS and RobotLegs.  It starts at http://tobiasgoeschel.com/2012/blaze1/, which handles creating a BlazeDS project via Maven.  
The part relevant to the source code here begins at http://tobiasgoeschel.com/2012/blaze3/, but you'll only get the whole picture if you've completed parts 1 and 2.
